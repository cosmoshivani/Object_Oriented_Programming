# Object_Oriented_Programming
my notes and codes while learning object oriented in Python

I'm using this website : https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/

to understand the basic concepts and testing my codes in an online compiler : https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler

the examples they have used are all including dogs and I'm changing and altering after understanding the code
and including all the example codes with cats tested in the same compiler
